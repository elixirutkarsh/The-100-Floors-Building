# The-100-Floors-Building
You are given two identical eggs and access to a 100-floor building. The eggs are strong enough that they can be dropped from certain floors without breaking, and weak enough that they will break if dropped from higher floors. What is the minimum number of drops you need to ensure you can find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking?
Solution :
The optimal solution is to drop the first egg from floors that are multiples of 14. If the first egg breaks, you can drop the second egg one floor at a time from the floor where you left off with the first egg. In the worst-case scenario, this method allows you to find the correct floor with 14 drops. Here's why:
If the first egg breaks on the first drop (floor 14), you can check all the floors below with the second egg, up to 13 more drops, for a total of 14 drops maximum. If the first egg breaks at the second drop (floor 28), you can check all the floors between 15 and 27 with the second egg, which takes at most 13 more drops, for a total of 15 drops maximum. This pattern continues up to floor 100, with the number of drops needed decreasing by one each time the first egg doesn't break.
